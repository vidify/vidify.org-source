I'm officially releasing Vidify's website!

This site is intended for non-developers, I'll migrate part of the [GitHub](https://github.com/vidify/vidify) documentation here on how to use Vidify. The wiki is also better managed in here because multiple languages can be used easily, and anyone can still contribute by making a PR to [vidify/vidify.org-source](https://github.com/vidify/vidify.org-source), which is better than wiki contributions.

I still have to polish it a lot, but it's ready to be public already. If you find any issues please let me know in an issue.

The site is only partially translated to Dutch. The wiki articles have been translated by [Andrew Ammerlaan on GitHub](https://github.com/AndrewAmmerlaan).
